# IBM-HR-Dashboard
I created an IBM HR Dashboard in Tableau to analyze workforce demographics, job roles, and salaries. I used charts for gender distribution, marital status, education fields, and average age by department. The dashboard also visualizes salary distribution and employee experience, offering a clear view of workforce composition and compensation.
