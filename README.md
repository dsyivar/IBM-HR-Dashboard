# IBM-HR-Dashboard
I created an IBM HR Dashboard in Tableau to analyze workforce demographics, job roles, and salaries. I used charts for gender distribution, marital status, education fields, and average age by department. The dashboard also visualizes salary distribution and employee experience, offering a clear view of workforce composition and compensation.

AN OVERVIEW:
This IBM HR Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the company’s workforce demographics, job roles, and employment statistics. I designed this dashboard in Tableau to offer a clear and interactive view of employee data. The dashboard begins with an analysis of the average age of employees across departments and job roles, categorized by gender. A pie chart visually represents the overall gender distribution in the company, revealing that 60% of employees are male and 40% of employees are female. The treemap displays the marital status of employees by gender, offering insights into the proportions of married, single, and divorced individuals. A line chart shows the number of companies employees have worked for, with a notable peak for those who have worked at just one company. I further explored the workforce’s educational background using a bar chart, identifying Life Sciences as the most common field. The dashboard also includes a bar chart showing the average monthly income by department and job role, highlighting salary distribution across various roles. Additionally, a detailed table lists the total number of employees in each department and job role. Through a consistent layout and color scheme, this dashboard provides a clear, data-driven view of IBM’s workforce, allowing for easy analysis of employee demographics, experience, education, and compensation.
